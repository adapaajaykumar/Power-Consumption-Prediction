About Power Consumption Prediction in a Particular Area. 
The "Electric Energy Power Prediction with Regression" project is a data-driven endeavor aimed at forecasting and understanding electric energy consumption based on various influencing factors. Electric energy consumption is a critical aspect of modern life, affecting individuals, businesses, and economies globally. Accurate predictions of energy consumption have far-reaching implications, including optimizing energy production and distribution, improving energy efficiency, and managing costs.

This project leverages the power of regression analysis, a statistical modeling technique, to create a predictive model for electric energy consumption, by examining historical energy consumption data concerning various relevant variables, such as temperature, time of day, or economic indicators.
